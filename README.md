The home page is just a welcome screen with a button to take the user to a table reservation app. Soon the back-end for it will be built. The about page, includes simple description about the restaurant and a simple full screen gallery. The menu page, has the information about the menu of the restaurant and last but not least is the contact page, simple contact form and google maps.
